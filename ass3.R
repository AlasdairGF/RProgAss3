## Part Two (no part one)
best <- function(state, outcome) {
      ## Read outcome data
      ## Check that state and outcome are valid
      ## Return hospital name in that state with lowest 30-day death
      ## rate
}

## Part Three
rankhospital <- function(state, outcome, num = "best") {
      ## Read outcome data
      ## Check that state and outcome are valid
      ## Return hospital name in that state with the given rank
      ## 30-day death rate
}

## Part Four
rankall <- function(outcome, num = "best") {
      ## Read outcome data
      ## Check that state and outcome are valid
      ## For each state, find the hospital of the given rank
      ## Return a data frame with the hospital names and the
      ## (abbreviated) state name
}
